# Vapours Please
**A Vapour-wave themed take on Papers Please, but for financial transactions using the Capital One Hackathon API.**

## What is Vapours Please?
In Vapours Please, you examine different peoples' bank accounts and transactions, searching for fraudulent purchases. Check each account's balance and the transaction amount to check for fraud, then either accept or deny it. The more transactions you accept, the more rules there are to deal with.

You'll get more points for every correct transaction you accept, and you'll have to keep the car topped up on fuel at stop points so you don't run out.

This game was made for HackSheffield 6. The theme that year was Vapourwave, which is why we used it for our art style.

### Download
Unfortunately, you can't run Vapours please yourself, as you need an API key, which you can only get from Capital One at certain Hackathons. Feel free to download and look through our source code though.
